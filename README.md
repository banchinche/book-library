# Library API

This project is an example of the library API implementation.

Also, this topic was chosen for course work **"API for library book management"**
and learning how to use FastAPI web-framework with SQLAlchemy (async).

# Tech-stack
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- JWT authentication
- Pgadmin (for development only)


# Diagrams

For course work I have prepared various UML-diagrams, 
you can find them 
[here](https://github.com/banchinche/book-library/tree/develop/diagrams).
